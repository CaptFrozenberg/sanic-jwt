Sanic JWT
=========

Sanic JWT is a module meant to add authentication protection and endpoints to a `Sanic <http://sanic.readthedocs.io>`_.

It is meant to be both __easy__ to get up and running, and __extensible__ for the developer. It can act to :doc:`protect endpoints <pages/protected>` and also :doc:`provide authentication scoping <pages/scoped>`, all wrapped into a nice `JWT <https://jwt.io>`_.

Pick your favorite user management system, run :doc:`a single function to initialize <pages/initialization>`, and you are all set.
